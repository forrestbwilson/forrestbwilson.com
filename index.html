        <p class="mb-5">Hello! My name is Forrest and welcome to my website! Feel free to check out the work and
          projects I've been involved with. About me? After graduating from Hampden-Sydney College with a degree in Economics
          and Business, I started travelling the world, visiting and/or living in ten countries while exploring myself, my passions, the world, and what's important to me. I've held a corporate role
          in finance, worked in or founded several startups, started an educational non-profit in Washington, D.C., contracted for businesses in several capacities,
          and worked as a wine associate 
          while reconnecting with myself and my purpose in life.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5"></p>
        I understand the purpose of work to be serving others and the planet and I'm currently seeking opportunities in
        startups where I can help facilitate the development of human beings, raise the collective consciousness of our
        planet, and bring about global good.
        I'm passionate about education, technology, health and wellness, environmental conservation, entrepreneurship,
        golf, and political economy. I enjoy working on teams with
        others interested in the development of themselves, the team, and the products and services we are offering as
        our gifts. I believe in the power of individuals to make meaningful change and I align myself with others who 
        are in alignment with my beliefs and values. Please feel free to reach out and connect!

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Dormie</div>
            <p>I've played competitive golf my entire life and I've always found it difficult to find other golfers to
              play
              with at my skill level. For that reason, I invented a mobile app (available for iOS and Android) to
              connect
              competitive golfers. For this project, I put together and led a team of 4 through the design (UI) and
              user
              experience (UX) process, app development, and co-creating a proprietary algorithm to rank golfers on our
              in-app
              leaderboard, business development, and marketing the app to golfers.</p>
            <p>- The UX/ UI process included creating user personas, user stories, a user-centered business canvas,
              mockups,
              and leading user feedback sessions</p>
            <p>- App development included serving as scrum master, putting together sprint schedules, and working with
              engineers
              to develop our software
            </p>
            <p>- Co-creating proprietary algorithm included working with our data scientist on prototyping and
              designing
              algorithm to fit our golf use cases</p>
            <p>- Business development included networking and partnering with golf courses, leading industry
              professionals
              (Top 100 golf instructors), and golf brands</p>
            <p>- Marketing included social media strategy and management, website design, commercial video production,
              attending
              golf trade shows, and hosting events to generate awareness for our product</p>
            <p>Additionally I led the team through personal, team, and organizational development exercises, including
              feedback
              sessions, training on adult-development polarities, and introduction to various system dynamics models. I
              also
              worked with and coached team members individually on their own capacity for leadership, how to show up
              fully
              and authentically, and how to bring their best self to the team, app, and project.</p>

            <p>DivvyCar “ZipCar for Uber drivers” offered rideshare drivers access to a vehicle on-demand in Virginia and Washington,
            D.C. Our driver partners had access to our fleet of hybrid vehicles through our website, booking a car whenever needed
            for any amount of time. I initially got involved with DivvyCar as an investor and later stepped in as CEO as the
            business grew. We decided to sell our fleet of cars in 2018 due to changing market conditions, specifically Uber and
            Lyft’s steadily decreasing base and per mile fares and Uber and Lyft partnering with car manufacturers to provide
            financing for vehicles to rideshare drivers.</p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3"><a href="http://www.itnlindia.com/" target="_blank">ITNL International Private Limited</a></div>
            <p>After graduating from college, I moved to Singapore to start my career working for a Mumbai based infrastructure
            financing and development firm, ITNL.</p>
            
            <p>My job responsibilities began with researching our target countries for projects we would be interested in and qualified
            for based on geo-political climate, risk allocation, and sources of funding. As the project moved forward, I was
            responsible for managing the qualification and proposal process both internally and externally. Internally, I
            coordinated our engineering, finance, and legal teams to compose and review bidding, concession, and project agreements.
            I also secured bank guarantees and performance bonds. Externally, I would meet with key government officials to discuss
            project requirements, introduce ITNL, and demonstrate our capacity for executing a project. Our average bid for a
            project was USD $125 million, with a high watermark of USD $275 million. I gave regular updates to management and
            reported our results to the Board of Directors.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to my primary job responsibilities, I assisted our CFO with creating financial models and investor
            presentations for a bond we issued in the Chinese Offshore RMB debt markets. Bond value – USD $100 mil</p>
            
            <p>I also attended Global Infrastructure Conferences, both in Dubai and in Vietnam. A highlight of my work experience with
            ITNL was having the opportunity to present to the World Bank and the Ministry of Transport in Vietnam on bringing
            private financing into public infrastructure projects.</p>
