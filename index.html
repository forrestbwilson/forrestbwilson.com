        <p class="mb-5">Hello! My name is Forrest and welcome to my website! Feel free to check out the work and projects I’ve been involved
        with. About me? After graduating from Hampden- Sydney College with a degree in economics and business, I started
        traveling the world, visiting and/or living in ten countries while gaining experience in a range of different roles and
        industries.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
        I understand the purpose of work to be serving others and the planet and I’m currently seeking opportunities in startups
        where I can help facilitate the development of human beings and bring about global good. I have a strong technical
        background from working in finance and software development; however, I excel most in roles where leverage my technical
        competencies into working directly with people, usually as a project manager or in sales and business development. I have
        years of experience working with leadership and organizational development consultants and I'm interested in bringing my
        knowledge for developing leaders and teams into projects I’m working on. I believe in the power of individuals to make meaningful change and I align myself with 
        others who are in alignment with my beliefs and values. Please feel free to reach out and connect!

            <p>I've played competitive golf my entire life and I've always found it difficult to find other golfers to
              play
              with at my skill level. For that reason, I invented a mobile app (available for iOS and Android) to
              connect
              competitive golfers. For this project, I put together and led a team of 4 through the design (UI) and
              user
              experience (UX) process, app development, and co-creating a proprietary algorithm to rank golfers on our
              in-app
              leaderboard</p>
            <p>- The UX/ UI process included creating user personas, user stories, a user-centered business canvas,
              mockups,
              and leading user feedback sessions</p>
            <p>- App development included serving as scrum master, putting together sprint schedules, and working with
              engineers to develop our software. Tech stack: React Native, Redux, Apollo, React Navigation, Expo, LoDash, GraphQL, GraphCool, Lottie, Flexbox</p>
            <p>- Co-creating proprietary algorithm included working with our data scientist on prototyping and
              designing algorithm to fit our golf use cases. We wrote the algorithmn in Python.</p>
            <p>- Marketing included social media strategy and management, website design, commercial video production,
              attending golf trade shows, and hosting events to generate awareness for our product</p>

            <p>Sonoma Cellar is a California-inspired tasting room and bistro in Alexandria, Va. I’ve always had a passion for wine and
            working at Sonoma Cellar gave me the opportunity to leverage that passion into a leadership and management position.</p>

            <p>My responsibilities as Wine Associate included working the tasting table, working on and off-site events, and meeting
            with distributors to do wine tastings and select which wines Sonoma Cellar would purchase.</p>
            
            <p>My managerial responsibilities included opening and closing the shop, meaning handling cash for the organization and
            overseeing daily opening and closing procedures. I also led leadership meetings with the owners and our leadership teams
            for both front and back of house. I worked with our wine educator to develop modules and a program to develop staff’s
            wine knowledge.</p>
            
            <p>I was the lead and point of contact on a project with three MBA students from Virginia Tech. We helped Sonoma Cellar
            implement new operational systems, process flows, inventory management systems, structured employee training, and an
            updated strategic plan.</p>

            <p>In January 2017, I was contracted to increase membership for the Online Lenders Alliance. I reached out

            for any amount of time. I initially got involved with DivvyCar as an investor and later stepped in as CEO as the
            business grew. We decided to sell our fleet of cars in 2018 due to changing market conditions, specifically Uber and
            Lyft’s steadily decreasing base and per mile fares and Uber and Lyft partnering with car manufacturers to provide
            financing for vehicles to rideshare drivers.</p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3"><a href="http://www.itnlindia.com/" target="_blank">ITNL International Private Limited</a></div>
            <p>After graduating from college, I moved to Singapore to start my career working for a Mumbai based infrastructure
            financing and development firm, ITNL.</p>
            
            <p>My job responsibilities began with researching our target countries for projects we would be interested in and qualified
            for based on geo-political climate, risk allocation, and sources of funding. As the project moved forward, I was
            responsible for managing the qualification and proposal process both internally and externally. Internally, I
            coordinated our engineering, finance, and legal teams to compose and review bidding, concession, and project agreements.
            I also secured bank guarantees and performance bonds. Externally, I would meet with key government officials to discuss
            project requirements, introduce ITNL, and demonstrate our capacity for executing a project. Our average bid for a
            project was USD $125 million, with a high watermark of USD $275 million. I gave regular updates to management and
            reported our results to the Board of Directors.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to my primary job responsibilities, I assisted our CFO with creating financial models and investor
            presentations for a bond we issued in the Chinese Offshore RMB debt markets. Bond value – USD $100 mil</p>
            
            <p>I also attended Global Infrastructure Conferences, both in Dubai and in Vietnam. A highlight of my work experience with
            ITNL was having the opportunity to present to the World Bank and the Ministry of Transport in Vietnam on bringing
            private financing into public infrastructure projects.</p>
